                                    This project aims to allow you to train your own Speech Recognition ML Model and utilize it in your own projects by interacting with it via an API.
                                    Included a pre-trained model that you can utilize instead of a custom one. This pre-trained model was trained on the LibriSpeech dataset, it as a Word-Error-Rate
                                    (WER) of 28%.

                                    At Hellman Hotel, we take pride in treating our guests with honor, dignity, and respect. Except for the Journalist, he’s been shot in the face. 
                                    He’s been spilling so much tea in his articles that he’s had it coming. I’m the unbiased narrator and I’m glad it happened.
                                    <br>
                                    Anyways, the Bellhop must investigate the Boxer, the Chef, and the Politician in this escape room/murder-mystery type game.  Each suite will 
                                    consist of puzzles and clues that will help you uncover the truth. Bring justice to the Journalist by tracking down his murderer! Or don’t, 
                                    he’s kind of a piece of shit.

                                    Based in a ward time. You are part of a military convoy transporting sensitive documents. When your fleet was set upon by enemy 
                                    forces. Despite your teams best effort, the enemy is able to overpower you; causing the entire fleet to crash. Somehow you 
                                    manage to survive, but you notice that the crash site has been picked clean by the enemy. You find yourself behind enemy lines, 
                                    sensitive battle plans stolen, and your entire team killed. Your goal is to find your way back to the base; while collecting the 
                                    correspondence that the enemy stole along the way.
